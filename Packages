Description: A beautifully unified simple and familiar iOS theme... Now comes with custom Wallpapers!
 I built this theme to feel familiar while also communicating a coherent design language for your icons that third party developers, and even apple, fail to provide.
 instructions embodied in this package,
 Stemming from the insect order Phasmida, I chose the name mida, with a lower case m, because the theme was designed to -blend in-.
