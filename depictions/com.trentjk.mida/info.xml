			NOTE: An update to mida is coming soon!<br/>
			<br/>A beautifully unified simple and familiar iOS theme...<br/>
			<br/>I built this theme to feel familiar while also communicating a coherent design language for your icons that third party developers, and even Apple, fail to provide. Stemming from the insect order Phasmida, I chose the name mida, with a lower case m, because the theme was designed to 'blend in'.<br/>
